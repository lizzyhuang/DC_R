## Methodology

We use the multinomial logistic regression model for estimation. The response variable `result` has 3 levels: win, loss, and draw. We use 

* `game_type`, 
* `team_shoton`, `opponent_shoton`, `team_shotoff`, `opponent_shotoff`,
* `team_corner`, `opponent_corner`,
* `team_cross`, `opponent_cross`,
*  `team_pos`, `opponent_pos`

as the explanatory variables to predict the results. 

To avoid overfitting, we apply the penalized LASSO model with hyperparameter `lambda` ($\lambda$).
