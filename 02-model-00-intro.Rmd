# Model

We use the multinomial logistic regression model for estimation. The response variable `result` has 3 levels: win, loss, and draw. We use 

* `game_type`, 
* `team_shoton`, `opponent_shoton`, `team_shotoff`, `opponent_shotoff`,
* `team_corner`, `opponent_corner`,
* `team_cross`, `opponent_cross`,
*  `team_pos`, `opponent_pos`

as the explanatory variables to predict the results. 

Here we select seasons 2008/2009 - 2014/2015 as the training data, and the last season 2015/2016 as the testing data. 

To avoid overfitting, we apply the penalized LASSO model with hyperparameter `lambda` ($\lambda$).

```{r ignore-missing, echo = FALSE}
missing = sum(!complete.cases(game))
game_clean = game[complete.cases(game), ]

train.seasons = c("2008/2009", "2009/2010", "2010/2011", "2011/2012", "2012/2013", "2013/2014", "2014/2015")

training.df = game_clean[game_clean$season %in% train.seasons, ]
test.df = game_clean[!(game_clean$season %in% train.seasons), ]

training.num = nrow(training.df)
test.num = nrow(test.df)
```


We also ignore records with missing values. There are `r missing` records with missing values on the inputs. This leaves us 514 records in the training data set, and 72 records in the test data set.
